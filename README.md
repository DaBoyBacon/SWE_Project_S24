How to edit as not part of the dev team:
- Create a clone of the repository
- Make whatever changes you want
- Ensure that all UnitTests still work. You can do this using the MasterUnitTest file, which will run all unit tests and check every unit test. **THE EARLIER AN ERROR IS FOUND, THE MORE LIKELY THAT ERROR IS TO IMPACT THE REST OF THE PROCESS**
- Feel free to run! We can't guarantee success but you built the damn thing, you better trust it

How to edit as part of the dev team:
- Create a branch with the following format: GithubName_Feature_Unit_VersionNumber

- Push to YOUR BRANCH - any merging with main will be done by lead devs
- You aren't getting paid for this so don't expect to be compensated. This is a project for a class.
